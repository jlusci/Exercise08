"TIME CUBE 4ce"
 
 
In 1884,  meridian time personnel met
 in Washington to change Earth time.
First words said was that only 1 day
could be used on Earth to not change
 the 1 day bible. So they applied the 1
day  and  ignored  the  other  3 days.
The bible time was wrong then and it
 proved wrong today. This a major lie
  has so much evil feed from it's wrong.
No man on Earth has no belly-button,
  it proves every believer on Earth a liar.

 Evil God Believers refuse to

rotating simultaneously around 
4 quadrant created Earth - 
in only 1 rotation, voiding the 
Oneism Evil  1 Day 1 God. 
You worship Satanic impostor 
guised by educators as 1 god.

No 1 God equals 4 - 24 hour 
Days Rotating Simultaneously 
within 1- 24 hour Rotation of 
 4 quadrant created Earth. 
Ignoring 4 Corner Earth Days 
will Destroy Evil Humanity. 
I am organizing Children to 
join "Cubic Army of 4 Days" 
to convert Evil 1 Day Adults 
to 4 Day mentality existence, 
to serve perpetual humanity.

"Nothing on Earth more Evil 
than a human educated as 1, 
when composed of opposites 
that cancel out as an entity." 
In fact, man is the only 1 Evil, 
and will soon erase himself by 
ignoring Cubic 4 Day Creation. 
If a Man cannot tear a page 
from the bible and burn it - 
then he cannot be a scientist, 
or participate in Symposium - 
to measure Cubing of Earth 
with Cubic intelligence wiser 
than any man or god known. 
Educators have destroyed the 
human analytical brain to a 
single perspective, in spite of 
all creation within  Universe 
being based upon opposites, 
binaries & antipodes, including 
Sun/Earth binary relative to the

 human male/female binary. No 
 ancient insignificant dead 1 Jew 
 godism can match or exceed the 
enormity of the Sun/Earth 
Binary. His heart is not big 
enough for sharing with the 
vastness of created opposites. 
1 has no heart beat or breath, 
constituting death of opposites. 
God in Human form has human

 limits as body controls activity. 
You are taught Evil, You act 
Evil, You are the Evil on Earth. 
Only your comprehending the 
Divinity of Cubic Creation will 
your soul be saved from your 
created hell on Earth - induced 
by your ignoring the existing 
4 corner harmonic simultaneous 
 4 Days rotating in a single cycle 
of the Earth sphere. Religious/ 
Academic Pedants cannot allow 
4 Days that contradict 1Day 1God. 
Educators destroy your brain, 
but you don't know, so why care?

Creation ocurrs via opposites, 
but Religious/Academia pedants 
suppress it teaching Satanic One.

After 30 years of research, I now 
possess the Order of Harmonic 
Antipodal Cubic Divinity Life - 
too large for physical form, but 
Binary Spirit of the masculinity 
Sun & feminity Earth Antipodes. 
ONEism is demonic Death Math. 
I have so much to teach you, but 
you ignore me you evil asses. 
You will recognize 4 corner Days 
or incur Easter Island Ending.

Never a Genius knew Math 
to achieve my Cubic Wisdom. 
Cubic thought Reigns as the 
Highest Intelligence possible 
on the planet Earth. One 96 
hour rotating Cube within a 
single rotation of Earth -- is 
an Ineffable Transcendence. 
Bible and Science falsify 1 
corner day for the Cubic 4 
corner Days rotating daily. 
A single god is not possible 
in our 4 Day Cubic Science, 
that equates Cubic Divinity. 
Everybody is both stupid and 
evil for ignoring the 4 days. 
Cube Divinity transcends all 
knowledge, Humans can't 
escape 4 corner Cubic Life. 
Fools worship mechanics of 
language - while they wallow 
in fictitious & deceitful word. 
Exact science based on Cubics, 
not on theories. Wisdom is 
Cubic testing of knowledge. 
Academia is progression of 
Ignorance.   No god equals 
Simultaneous 4 Day Creation. 
Humans ignore their 4 corner 
stages of life metamorphosis. 
This site is a collection of data 
for a coming book - peruse it. 
No human has 2 hands as they 
are opposites, like plus and 
minus, that cancel as entity. 
Academia destroys your brain, 
your ability to think opposite. 
The eyes of the flounder fish 
were relocated, why were yours

 relocated? Your opposite eyes 
were moved to 1 corner to overlay 
for single perspective, but that 
corrupts your Opposite Brain.

Creation is the Harmonics of Opposites - 
Opposites are the Harmonics of Creation. 
God entity is queer sex, or no opposite sex. 
God Oners must ban all sex with Opposites. 
Trinity of males degrade female opposites. 
Sex okay for atheist, but not God Oneists. 
Opposite hemispheres equate planets to a 
Giant Brain, that has 4 faces, but no limbs. 
Adults create baby, baby evolves to adult. 
No 1 God can create a planet of opposites, 
which equate to a zero value existence, and 
cancels to nothing as an entity in death.

NO GOD EQUATES 
SIMULTANEOUS 
4 DAY CREATION, 
in 1 Earth rotation.

 Cubic Creation of 4 corner 
separate simultaneous 24 
hour Days within 1 Earth 
rotation - transcends and 
contradicts the 1 Day 
rotation/1 God Creation 
of Christianity - and all 
ONEism / Singularity 
religions - proving them 
to constitute Evil on Earth 
for the parallel Opposites.

Hey - got a death threat 
from Temporal Phoenix 
last night, saying that the 
big ole boys that make the 
world go round, are going 
to wipe me off the Earth. 
They can't allow the Time 
Cube Principle to continue.

Opposites Create, not God, 
who equates queer creator 
and masturbation creation 
of Evil Oneness Educators. 
Oneism equates to evil lie, 
and Death for Opposites 
of Hemispheres and Sexes.

Wikipedia claim that the 
Time Cube is non-science 
constitutes a Grave error 
by the half-brain bastard 
who can't think opposite 
of the lies he was taught.

I was born to think Cubic 
as in a 4 corner family life, 
therefore I rise above you. 
You are educated Stupid, 
You are educated Evil --- 
You will ignore message 
& attack the messenger. 
Man invented his God in 
man's character - Stupid 
Oneism and Singularity 
in Universe of Opposites.

You worship an evil god 
who allows babies to starve 
to death while you gorge?

God BELIEF succumbs to 
The Cubic Law of Nature. 
Opposite sex organs prove 
male & female to be binary 
opposites equal zero value, 
and nothing as unified one. 
You are educated ENTITY 
STUPID for all Creation is 
composed of Opposites ---- 
which equate to Zero value 
existence - and cancels out 
to nothing if unified as one. 
Before Word was invented, 
no God existed upon Earth. 
Truth cannot be uttered so 
that's why I am writing it. 
 

CUBIC TIME CUBES

Earth, Life, and Truth --- 
contradicts 1 Day Gods, 
  and ineffable by human. 
Nature enforces a LAW 
against God existence. 
No god equals 4 corner 
simultaneous days in a 
single rotation of Earth. 
No god equals 4 corner 
stages of metamorphic 
rotating humanity - as a 
baby, child, parent and 
grandparent evolution.

 Cubic Creation Wisdom 
 empowers me above all 
  the 1 day gods on Earth.

  Jew owners of religious/ 
 academic christianity -- 
  have enslaved your ass, 
and you are too stupid 
 to know you are a slave 
to plunder profiteers of 
Earth's Cubic Nature.

  What queer mentality you 
have --- to worship an old 
dead Jew as God/Creator.

NO God creates himself -- 
and besides that, he is also 
composed of opposites that 
contradicts entity creation. 
No God can even exist in 
our Universe of Opposites. 
Opposites transcend Entity. 
Entity equals cancellation 
--- the death of Opposites.

  Evil Educated "Singularity" 
Stupid - ignores the Cubic 
Wisdom of Wisest Human 
and The Greatest Thinker.

No human or god can match 
Nature's simultaneous 4 day 
rotation in 1 Earth rotation.

No human has a right to 
believe wrong  -  for that 
would  be  evil  thinking.

Ignorance of 4 days is evil, 
Evil educators teach 1 day. 
1 day will destroy humans.

OPPOSITES CREATE. 
Mother and father gave me birth, not a queer jew god.

Singularity god is EVIL as 
Creation reigns as Opposite. 
Educators, and You - ought 
to be killed for ignoring the 
fact that "Earth is Cubed". 
(ignored and suppressed by EVIL educators)

NASA's Moon Landing was 
far less of an achievement 
than Time Cube discovery, 
for I have Cubed the Earth, 
with 4 simultaneous corner 
days in 1 rotation of Earth. 
(singularity belief scientist can't comprehend T.O.E.)

God SINGULARITY and the 
academic taught singularity 
constitute great evils in the 
Cubic World of Opposites - 
Opposites hemispheres and 
Opposite sexes of humanity. 
The  Universe  is composed 
of Opposites - existing only 
as Opposites  -  with a zero 
value existence - cancelling 
to nothing as a singularity.

I think Cubic,  therefore I 
rise above the singularity 
mentality human and the 
false gods they worship - 
discovering a Universe of 
Opposites their education 
will never allow them to 
know.   Evil of believing 
is not measuring and the 
result of not measuring - 
is never knowing Truth, 
ineffable by man or god.

DOG BRAIN STUDENTS

Singularity "education"

an inability to ever think

unlikely  to  ever  recover

Days in 1 Earth Rotation.

Dr. Gene Ray, Cubic and Wise Above God. 
******************************************** 
Cubic Nature is Omnific, 
Infinite, Ineffable and 
on Harmonic duty today.

Singularity has no God 
within "The Universe of 
Opposite Corner Life" - 
opposite hemispheres 
and opposite sexes - by 
which all Earth life exist. 
For as long as you dumbass, 
educated stupid and evil 
bastards IGNORE Cubic 
Creation, your sons and 
daughters deserve to die 
and be maimed in foreign 
lands - while killing innocent 
women and children. Keep 
ignoring me you evil asses 
and observe the slaughter of 
your children protecting the 
oil barons ripping off their 
families back home. The 
enemy is back home, not 
in foreign lands. Ignore me 
& keep counting the dead sons. 
Creation occurs via opposites. 
Singularity is the death math 
of religious/academic Godism. 
Earth Opposites should split 
apart - and cascade molten 
lava upon God Worshippers, 
for they are the evil on Earth. 
If god is your father, your mother is a whore. 
Opposite Creation vs evil god entity. 
He who speaks, preaches, teaches, condones 
or practices SINGULARITY - an evil that 
equates DEATH by cancellation of universal 
OPPOSITES - hemispheres, sexes, seasons, 
races, temperatures, marriages and divided 
cell (the human Cubic who rotates a 4 corner 
stage family rotating metamorphic lifetime) - 
should have their evil lying tongue cut out. 
Educators are lying bastards. 
-1 x -1= +1 is WRONG, it is 
academic stupidity and is evil. 
The educated stupid should acknowledge 
the natural antipodes of+1 x +1 = +1and 
-1 x -1 = -1 exist as plus and minus values 
of opposite creation - depicted by opposite 
sexes and opposite hemispheres. Entity is 
death worship - for it cancels opposites. 
I have invested 30 years of my life and over 
1/4 millions dollars researching Nature's 4 - 
simultaneous 24 hour days within a single 
rotation of Earth. Religious/Academic word 
taught singularity is contradicted as evil lies 
by the simple math of the Cube's Opposite 
Corners - the most perfect symmetry within 
the Universe.  Academic SINGULARITY 
is a contradiction to the opposite sexes, the 
opposite hemispheres and to the universe of 
opposites that exist as a zero value existence. 
The academic taught singularity/entity is but 
poison fed the human populace - slow death. 
I can say that educators "eat shit" and they 
only cower and hide, doing nothing that will 
induce debate, that will indict them as evil. 
Americans will die SINGULARITY stupid, 
their brain lobotomized by EVIL educators. 
Neither EARTH or HUMAN 
exist as entities, but opposites. 
Earth is composed of opposite hemispheres 
which rotate in opposite directions - equal 
to a zero value existence (plus & minus). As 
entity, the opposite hemispheres cancel out. 
Earth exist as 4 - 90 degree opposite corner 
quadrants, but not as a 360 degree circle. 
Earth is Cubic opposites, nothing as circle. 
A singularity inflicted scholar  has not the 
mentality,  freedom  or  guts  to know that 
academia is a Trojan Horse mind control. 
Singularity brotherhood owns your brain, 
destroying your ability to think Cubicism. 
Evil academia blocks out Time Cube site 
and suppresses its discussion and debate. 
You are an educated singularity idiot who 
can stupidly deny Nature's Harmonic 4 
simultaneous 24 hour days within a single 
rotation of Earth, or even make parody of 
the Cubic Creation Principle - but your 
mental ability to comprehend thegreatest 
social and scientific discovery of all human 
existence has been lobotomized by the evil 
academic singularity bastards hired to 
destroy your ability to think opposite. You 
cannot comprehend Opposite Creation. 
Religous/academic taught singularity is the 
reduction of the human mind to android. 
The half of Earth seen from 
space, cannot exist without 
the opposite half not seen... 
existing as opposite values. 
Earth entity does not exist - 
for it is composed of opposite 
hemispheres which rotate in 
opposite directions - equating 
to a zero value existence, and 
to nothing as a "singularity". 
You were educated to live an 
evil lie - and your heirs will 
suffer hell for your stupidity. 
The entity you seek is death. 
Educators teach assumed math, but are too 
damn dumb, stupid and evil to know that 
until Word is cornered, Math is fictitious. 
Academic/Religious Word is a fictitious 
Trojan Horse and the most efficient form 
of human enslavement ever concocted by 
"Singularity Brotherhood of Bastardism". 
I INVOKE a CURSE upon the educators 
that their students will awake from their 
academic induced stupor & seek revenge. 
You are evil to believe in the 
singularity concept of a God, 
for the whole Universe and 
everthing within is composed 
of Opposites - which exists 
only as Opposites with a zero 
value existence - and nothing 
as an entity.  When adults go 
to heaven, children still living 
on Earth will burn in the hell 
that adults created for them. 
Love of God is hate for child. 
Schools teach religious evil. 
YOU are a Cubic Creature, 
Opposites  create  Opposites. 
 Educated Singularity stupid, 
empowering evil way of life. 
Religious / academic taught 
Singularity is Evil & Murder. 
Academia has enslaved you 
as a Word Animal - kneel, 
you educated stupid jackass. 
I can lead you to 4 Wisdom, 
but I can't free your brain 
from the evil of singularity.

Academia teaches evil android singularity, 
displacing families with today's androids, 
passive, subsmissive, subservient &stupid. 
Religion is an evil singularity brotherhood 
contradicted by the simultaneous 4 corner 
24 hour days in a single rotation of Earth, 
and the 4 corner stages of a human lifetime. 
Opposite sexes equate a zero value existence. 
Family tribal/village are bodies of opposites. 
Religion/academia teach evil of singularity. 
Teaching singularity equals death by Word. 
Opposite sexes created you. 
Ignorance of the Time Cube, Life Cube & 
Ineffable Truth Cube, indicts you Stupid. 
Ignoring Cubic Creation indicts you evil. 
Singularity God impossible. 
Wikipedia allowing the educated stupid

Time Cube does  create  4 simultaneous 
24 hr. days. Both Americans & Wikipedia 
are evil to deny or ignore Cubic Creation. 
Is Wikipedia a Singularity Brotherhood 
controlled Trojan Horse indoctrination - 
that edits Time Cube to a negative view? 
Who edits the Time Cube on Wikipedia? 
It is evil for Coryoth to edit  Time Cube. 
Will I get reply or will the Wisest Human 
just be ignored until  silenced by death? 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
Religious Singularity is evil, 
Academic Singularity is evil. 
Singularity is damnable lie, 
Educators altered your mind, 
You cannot think opposite of 
what you were taught to think. 
You have a cyclop perspective 
and taught android mentality = 
lobotomized analytical ability. 
Educated singularity stupid - 
You can't think4 corner days. 
********************************************************************* 
4 Earth Quadrants simultaneously rotate 
inside 4 Time Cube Quarters to create 4 
- 24 hour days within one Earth rotation. 
 This simple ignored math indicts you evil. 
 Demand evil educators explain Cubicism, 
 or allow me to come teach Cube Creation. 
*********************************************************************** 
No man, nation or God equal 
Cube symmetry of opposites. 
Mathematically impossible for a Genius 
or any God to match my Cubic Wisdom. 
Educators fear me, they cower and run. 
6 sides constitutes a sextet -- not a Cube. 
Teaching that a Cube has '6 sides' with 
no top & bottom, induces an evil curse 
that pervades all academic institutions. 
Opposites create Opposites. 
Mom & Dad opposites create son & daughter opposites. 
Opposite Creators required, 
Depicted by Earth's opposite hemispheres. 
Singularity God impossible. 
Opposites  de-god  Religion. 
Opposites create the universe. 
Opposites compose the Earth. 
Opposites compose humanity. 
Opposites create your body. 
Opposites de-god academia. 
Opposites de-god singularity 
taught by religious/academia. 
I can call singularity educators the most 
putrid name on Earth and claim they eat 
cow-dung ambrosia,  but the lying ass 
bastards will not even object - for they 
know I am right and that any debate will 
indict them for the evil they perpetuate 
against the students and future humanity. 
Scientists know Time Cube, 
but any scientist supporting 
the 4 simultaneous days in a 
single rotation of Earth, will 
be fired and banned for life 
from academic institutions. 
Scientists are evil cowards 
and  should be castrated 
for obscurantism of the 4 
simultaneous days within 
a single rotation of Earth. 
Average people understand 
4 Day Creation when I tell 
them about it, but scientist 
can't accept it, for the evil 
bastards think singularity. 
Singularity can't procreate, 
a feat requiring opposites. 
Bible Word is a singularity. 
You are taught singularity. 
Singularity is death worship 
and damnation of humanity. 
No God equals the 4 corner 
simultaneous 24 hour days 
within single Earth rotation. 
The universe and all within 
it is composed of opposites. 
Religious/academic taught 
singularity is queer as 1 sex. 
Believing is not knowing - 
but evil that ignores facts. 
Santa vital to Christmas - 
No Santa - no Christmas. 
Why credit Santa LIE with 
gifts that parents buy their 
children? It bribes the child 
mind to accept false Santa 
spirit and false god spirit 
deceit associated with it. 
Santa Claus and Christmas 
must be indicted deceits 
that destroys child mind. 
God is but an adult Santa 
extension of child Santa - 
equating evil singularity - 
unnatural as 1 pole Earth. 
Earth has not 2 poles, but 
opposite poles that cancel 
each other out - if added. 
6 side Cube is Evil math, 
ignoring its top & bottom. 
-1 x -1 = +1 is Evil math, 
as +1 and -1 are antipodes 
equating a zero existence. 
3 Dimensions is erroneous 
math without a 4th corner 
perspective dimension. If 
ever allowed, Cubic debate 
will indict evil singularity 
as damnation of humanity. 
Believers are Evil - for not 
measuring. Result of belief is 
dyingstupid -you can know. 
Singularity education begets evil, 
for you were born as an opposite, 
between opposite sexes & the 
opposite Earth poles. You are 
educated as a stupid android 
slave to the evil Word Animal 
Singularity Brotherhood. Your 
analytical mind is lobotomized 
and you cannot think opposite 
of lies you are taught to think. 
You build the hell 'they'teach. 
  Dr.Gene Ray, Cubic and Wisest Human

You have opposite brains to think 
opposite, but Big Brother icepick 
academic lobotomy has destroyed 
your mentality to think opposite of 
the evil singularity you are taught. 
The 4 days is above your godism 
and you don't even want to know. 
Universe is composed of opposite 
hemispheres and opposite sexes - 
equating to + / -, a zero existence, 
depicted by Pyramid's bare coffer. 
Your 1Day God Makes You Evil. 
4 Corner Days Are Absolute, but 
ignored by stupid/evil educators. 
Until cornered, word is fictitious. 
God is product of fictitious word. 
4Day Cube Disproves 1Day God 
All creation within the universe is composed of 
opposite hemispheres and opposite sexes - with 
opposite races, opposite seasons, opposite luck, 
opposite directions and opposite perspectives - 
equating a harmonic rotating zero value existence. 
"To know all, is to know nothing". 
You must attack the word bastards who preach 
and teach evil godism and racism singularity lies, 
for any singularity brotherhood is mental slavery 
that desecrates family, village and tribal opposites. 
Americans are dumbass, educated stupid and evil 
singularity fools.  I will wager $10,000.00 that 
within the Cubic embodiment of Nature, there are 
4 simultaneous 24 hour days within a single rotation

of Earth. Acknowledge the math below or go to hell. 
4 Day Cube disproves 1 Day God.

1-Midday to midday = a 24 hour day rotation. 
2-Sundown to sundown = a 24 hour day rotation. 
3-Midnight to midnight = a 24 hour day rotation. 
4-Sunup to sunup = a 24 hour day rotation.

4 Day math condemns 1 Day fools. 
These 4 absolute simultaneous days PROVES the 
1 day god, 1day academia, 1 day religion and the 
1 day media to be erroneous, fictitious and evil lies. 
Education equates to a mass icepick lobotomy - 
destroying the mind's ability to think as opposites.

All 4/24 hour days occur within 1 Earth rotation. 
You educated stupid word animals can't fathom 
this greatest social and scientific math of creation.

God claimed to have created a single day 
rotation of Earth.  I have created simultaneous 
4 day rotation of Earth. Why do you worship 
such a stupid God?  Do you really believe that 
your Jew God screwed a hole in the ground to 
create Adam and Eve out of dirt, at the same 
time that woman existed in the nation of NOD, 
Nation of Damsels from where Cain got wife? 
Adam and Eve were created at the same time, 
but sexless. A rib was removed from eve and 
a hole left to make a woman of her. The rib 
was stuck on Adam to make a man of him - 
and Eve is still trying to get her rib back.

Recognition and application of this Cubic 
simultaneous 4 day rotation of Earth, 
will change all math, science and societies 
from the beginning of human existence. 
You have to be evil to ignore this math.

1-Midday to midday is a 24 hour rotation. 
2-Sundown to sundown is a 24 hour rotation. 
3-Midnight to midnight is a 24 hour rotation. 
4-Sunup to sunup is a 24 hour rotation.

4 Earth corners rotate 4 Time corners - 
for 4 simultaneous day rotation of Earth - 
equating the principle of a 4 pole motor. 
Academic bastards will deny the obvious. 
Americans are EVIL for ignoring Cubicism. 
******************************************************************************** 
Acknowledge the 4 days or you die evil. 
Do not pass this point without the 4 days. 
************************* 
Dr. Gene Ray, will be interviewed on 
FTL@freetalklive.com, at 8pm on 
Friday 7,  about Time Cube discovery - 
greatest discovery of human existence.

Humans are evil to worship 
singularity of 1day education, 
ignoring Nature's Harmonic 
Cubic Antipodal Creation. 
Academic singularity is as 
evil as God singularity evil. 
You have not the mentality 
to comprehend the simple math of Cubic 
antipode creation, for at about age 6, your 
parents gave your 2 opposite antipode brains 
to Big Brother academic hirelings, to clone 
  thought to serve evil singularity brotherhood - 
destroying Cubic families, villages and tribes. 
Creation is by opposites, opposite hemispheres 
and opposite sexes - not queer singularity. 
You've been educated stupid 
by "Big Brother" singularity. 
Singularity God is evil belief. 
Cubic antipode creation debunks singularity. 
Cube is the most perfect form of opposites. 
Opposite hemispheres equate opposite cubes. 
Opposite sex cubes equate to a crap-shoot. 
Your God claimed to have created a single 
day rotation of Earth.    I offer absolute 
proof that I have created 4 simultaneous 
24 hour days within a single rotation of 
Earth.  You worship "Evil Singularity", 
equating you to a "singularity bastard". 
Why do you worship a queer 1 day God? 
Are you content as a singularity queer? 
Einstein was singularity stupid, 
and you are singularity stupid. 
"Born Cubic, THINK CUBIC", 
you rotate a 4 corner stage life. 
Singularity educated humans 
are not intelligent. 
The universe does not exist, 
except as opposites - with a 
zero value existence.     Add 
the opposites together and 
the universe ceases to exist. 
********************************

******************************* 
All humans are created and 
exist between the opposites 
of male and female values. 
Add the opposites together 
and humans cease to exist. 
A single God is death and 
constitutes evil worship. 
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
I am flabbergasted that the 
"big brother" hired pedants 
can brainwash and indoctrinate 
the powerful antipode human 
mind to ignore the simple math 
of 4 simultaneous 24 hour days 
within a single rotation of Earth, 
to worship one and trash three. 
************************************************************************* 
EVIL OBSCURANTISM 
(Deliberately withholding CUBIC KNOWLEDGE) 
No human "entity" exists. 
Cube is opposite perfection. 
Singularity is death worship. 
*******************************************************************

CREATION IS CUBIC, but 
you are educated singularity 
stupid by academic bastards. 
Greenwich 1 day time is evil. 
Can you explain the 4 days 
rather than the 1 day taught? 
If not, you are truely stupid. 
To ignore the 4 days, is evil. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Can you tear and burn the bible, which 
represents Biblistic Selfnic Bastardism - 
contradicted by Cubic Creation of Family 
and Village Tribal Perpetual Bodies. If 
not, you are self-indicted as DUMB and 
EVIL SPINELESS WORD ANIMAL, 
totally ignorant of Nature's Cubic Life. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
I possess data, with proof, 
that will absolutely blow the 
lid off the present civilization. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
If the United States buries 80,000 tons of 
nuclear waste inside Mother Earth, for our 
children to inherit, then Americans will be 
the most evil bastards to ever inhabit a planet. 
A proper burial spot for nuclear waste is under 
academic institutions and in Washington D.C.. 
======================================================================================== 
Dr. Gene Ray, the Wisest Human, 
lectured on his Time Cube discovery at 
Georgia Tech, on April 14 at 7 pm. 
========================================================================================== 
Opposites ARE NOT entities. 
Earth nor human equal entity. 
Male/female = zero existence, 
as in 2 opposite hemispheres. 
Male+female cancel each out. 
My Cubic Wisdom debunks 1 sex gods. 
The  male god singularity and same sex 
trinity equates denouncing motherhood 
and supporting a state of queers - with 
a price of HIV devastating life on Earth. 
Faith IS NOT knowledge, 
but evil of not measuring. 
Apply analytical math to Earth sphere 
and discover 2 opposite hemispheres 
rotating in opposite directions - equal 
to a ZERO value existence.  Earth is 
not an entity, for adding the opposite 
values cancel each other to no existence. 
All the universe exist as opposite values. 
Academic and religious taught stupid 
SINGULARITY is greatest of all evil, as 
even humans are created via opposites. 
Evil academic bastards who preach 
singularity and block Cubic Creation 
debate, should be nailed to the cross. 
Your future is your plundered past. 
Today, you have the opportunity to 
make tomorrow better than yesterday. 
To do less, is a crime against children. 
Believers are ignorant of Cubic Creation 
and will be destroyed by their own word. 
All Creation occurs between Opposites. 
On Earth between opposite hemispheres, 
and for humans, opposites sexes. The 2 
opposite sexes equate to 2 separate Cubes, 
as if dice of femininity and masculinity - 
equating Human Life to a Crap-Shoot 
chance of exciting lifetime possibilities. 
Academic and religious taught singularity 
creation deserves a coming horrific hell.

I have demonstrated absolute proof 
of "Cubic Creation", through its 
attributes of 4 simultaneous 24 hour 
days within a single rotation of Earth.

I have $10,000.00 that I will 
wager that Cubicism transcends 
and disproves Theism Creation.

Also, proof that humans are Cubic 
forms that rotate a 4 corner face 
lifetime, not an entity as the 4 corner 
stage faces do not occur at the same 
time for the 1 corner face individual. 
There is absolute proof that Earth is 
not an entity as Earth is composed of 
2 opposite hemispheres (as in plus 
and minus), that would cancel each 
out if unified as an entity.  There is 
proof that all humans exist between 
the 2 opposites of femininity and 
masculinity, and would cancel each 
other out if unified as academic or 
religious "singularity" - equating to 
stupidity and suicide for humanity.

"Why something rather than nothing?"

Between the opposites, all 
things are created.  As an 
entity, they exist only as a 
big zero, seen from space 
as something and nothing 
from every possible view.

There is proof that 3 dimensional 
math is erroneous, and that linear 
Time is actually of a Cubic nature. 
Ignoring Cubium indicts you evil.

Scholars ravage Earth's resources. 
Scholars plunder America's Nature. 
Nevada's 77,000 ton nuclear waste 
burial should be made a monument 
to Scholasticism's evil singularity - 
contradicted by Cubic Created life, 
relative to the Cubium dipole atom. 
************************************************************ 
Time Cube is "T.O.E.", theory of everything. 
Time, Life and Truth =aCubic Principle, 
a natural creation of ineffable opposites. 
Caltechprofessorspractice obscurantism 
and can not ever allow Time Cube Debate - 
for it will indict the word bastards as evil. 
They can't argue it, their power is to ignore - 
and that's why students must demand debate. 
Word is most efficient form of enslavement. 
You have been educated singularity stupid. 
You have been educated in singularity evil. 
Self singularityis cursed form of humanity. 
Do you care to know that Cubic Creation 
debunks the Word God and Word World of 
the educated stupid human Word Animal? 
Evil educators suppress 
student free speech right 
to debate Cubic Creation. 
Evil students don't object. 
Cubicism debunks evil scientificsingularity. 
Cubicism debunks evil religioussingularity. 
Cubicism debunks evil word god singularity. 
Cubicism debunks evil academic singularity. 
Planets created via opposite rotating poles. 
Flag depicts opposite rotating hemispheres. 
Flag depicts 2 opposite side hemispheres
Creation of life occurs between 2 opposites. 
You're too stupid to know opposite creation. 
1 day singularity dooms Oppositehumanity. 
1 god singularity dooms Opposite Creation. 
Opposite Creation dooms human singularity. 
There's no human entity, only corner Cubics, 
rotating life's 4 corner stage metamorphosis. 
4 corner head has 1 corner face, 4 face life. 
Educated fools can't comprehend Cubicism. 
Life is as secure as existing on a razor edge. 
Apply reverse engineering to know creation. 
Humans are educated stupid Word Animals, 
creating a Word God and Word World, thus 
inflicting singularity as mange upon Nature. 
Singularity educators are unfit to even live. 
Wisdom is a Cubic measure of  Knowledge. 
Via Cubic Wisdom, I am the wisest human. 
Mind must see Cube eyes can't comprehend. 
Time Cube impose 4 corners on Earth sphere. 
Earth sphere is Cubic with rounded corners. 
Earth exists as2 opposite Cube hemispheres. 
Humans must establish 4 corner Earth Cube. 
All humans exist between2 opposite sexes. 
Impossible for a human singularity to exist. 
  2 opposite sex Cubes equate to crap shoot. 
Religion and academia preach singularity. 
Human word animals are singularity stupid. 
Evil singularity dooms Opposite Creation. 
YOU can't handle Cubic Time, Cubic Life 
or Cubic Truth - for insideof Time Cube 
equates the most magnificient symmetry 
of  opposites existing within the universe - 
for every corner has an equal opposite corner, 
every 2 corners has an equal opposite 2 
 corners, every  tri-corner has an equal 
opposite tri-corner and every 4 corners has 
an equal opposite 4 corners. No human or 
 god can utter such powerful ineffable 
opposite Cubic Truth.  God is singularity. 
Evil singularity dooms Opposite Creation.

******************************

Fools know not Nature's Cubic Creation. 
Children are sacrificed to deified hoax. 
God image is womanless queer likeness. 
No god equals harmonic 4 daycreation. 
Queer science theory forced on children. 
EVIL STEWARDSHIP - 
It is an evil government of evil adults to 
bury 77,000 tons of nuclear waste in the 
Nevada mountains as a heritage for their 
children, and keep on making it. Taught 
and preached cubeless SINGULARITY 
equates to an evil education within the 
realm of Nature's Harmonic Cubic Life. 
Wisdom is Cubic testing of knowledge. 
************************************************************************* 
Educated cubeless stupid, you think stupid. 
Why worship a dumb 1 day god when I 
demonstrate 4 simultaneous 24 hour days 
within a single 24 hour rotation of Earth? 
Linear, singularity and trinity equate to 
evil math within Nature's Cubic Creation 
********************************** 
You are a slave - to academic 
induced inculcated belief - an 
insidious entity, an evil which 
corrupts human mental ability 
to accept creation knowledge, 
as demonstrated in Cubicism. 
******************************************* 
Humans exist as CUBICS, not entities, 
for the 4 corner stages of rotating human 
metamorphosis do not occur at the same time 
for the individual - except for family Cube. 
You are educated stupid, indoctrinated evil, 
and can't even acknowledge that a mother 
and baby are the same age - on opposite 
corners of a Cubic Creation Principle - for 
Truth in Opposites contradict a god entity. 
Evil educators suppressCubic Creation and 
preach evil singularity to dumb students - 
dispossessing students of ratiocinate mind. 
WORD students serve Nature best if dead. 
****************************************************** 
The hollow Time Cube in which the 4 
quadrant corners of Earth rotate, equates to 
your 4 corner bedroom, or to a 4 corner 
classroom which represents the 4 corners 
of Earth - in which stupid and evil pedants 
teach dumb students 1 corner knowledge. 
Each of the 4 corners of Earth is the 
beginning and ending of its own separate 
24 hour day - all 4 simultaneous days within 
a single rotation of Earth.  Place 4 different 
students in the 4 corners of a classroom and 
rotate them 4 corners each. Note that they 
rotate simultaneously wthin the same Time 
frame as if only one is rotating - just as the 
4 different days on Earth rotate. 3D math 
applied within this hollow Cube would be 
erroneous math, as it would not account 
for the 4th corner perspective dimension. 
Place a 100 people within this Cubic like 
room and they will not increase the number 
of corners anymore than 6 billion people on 
Earth will increase the 4 corners of Earth. 
It is dumb, stupid, evil and unworthy of 
life on Earth to claim that this Creation 
Cube has 6 sides -  or no top and bottom. 
Academia equates to a deadly plague.


A mother and baby are the same age, as 
a 1 day old baby has a 1 day old mother. 
****************************************************************** 
I am not allowed to lecture at the word animal

Word animals will feel the wrath of Cubic curse. 
*********************************************************************** 
Creation of 4 simultaneous 24 hour days, 
within a single rotation of Earth, empowers 
me above all 1-day gods and educated stupid scientists. I will wager $10,000.00 on it.

My wisdom so antiquates known knowledge, that 
a psychiatrist examining my behavior, eccentric 
by his academic single corner knowledge, knows 
no course other than to judge me schizoprenic. In 
today's society of greed, men of word illusion are 
elected to lead and wise men are condemned. You 
must establish a Chair of Wisdom to empower 
Wise Men over the stupid intelligentsia, or perish. 
************************************************* 
All knowledge of the human 
word animal, is insignificant, 
when his fictitious word world 
is compared to Nature's own 
Dynamic & Harmonic Time 
Cube's  Creation  Principle. 
******************************************************* 
God created only a single 24 hour day 
rotation of Earth, while I have created 
4 simultaneous 24 hour days within a

am wiser than the word god, and all 
word worshipers. All words are fictitious. 
I will wager $10,000.00 that 
Cubic Creation is almighty. 
********************************************** 
All creation on Earth exists between the 2 
opposite poles, and if unified, would cancel 
and cease to exist. 
Humans exist only as opposites - with a 
zero value, for if unified, male and female 
would counter each other & cease to exist. 
**************************************** 
I have been informed that the academic 
pedant hirelings are conspiring to defame

Hey stupid - are you too 
dumb to know there are 
4 different simultaneous 
24 hour days within a

Each Earth corner rotates 
own separate 24 hour day. 
Infinite days is stupidity.

If I tell a human that his 4-corner

Corruption of Word

Academic free speech is a damn lie. Try 
to discuss & debate Nature's Time Cube 
and your evil teachers will not allow you. 
Ignorance of Time Cube dooms humans, 
 inflicting their own created "word hell". 
Educators are actually "evil word gods", 
teaching commercial plunder of Nature. 
The damn bastards suppress free speech, 
 by denying Time Cube debate discussion. 
Students MUST DEMAND free speech - 
 for the greatest of all human discoveries: 
Nature's Harmonic Simultaneous 4 Day 
Rotating Creation Principle of Cubicism. 
Educated stupid,  you can't know Truth. 
****************************************** 
Read physics of Santa Claus . Explain the 
physics of a god.  Belief has no inherent 
value,  but worship of such nonvalue as a 
god, equates to nonacceptance of Cubic 
knowledge - as demonstrated by ineffable 
Truth and the Highest Order of Wisdom. 
I can talk with a human for hours about 
the Time Cube and they will agree with 
every claim I make.  But at the end of the 
conversation, they remark that they believe 
in the nonvalue belief god and cannot 
accept Cubic Creation, regardless of all 
the ineffable Truth and Wisdom it proves. 
A Belief Matrix pulls a 1 day world over 
your eyes, while the real Cubic World has 
4 simultaneous days in 1 Earth rotation. 
Educators own your mind and fills it with 
garbage, that will soon destroy humanity.

Did you see the movie Matrix?  Actually the 
induced night "dream world" is synonymous 
with the academic religious induced daytime 
"word world" enslavement of humans. Word 
has no inherent value, as it was invented as a 
counterfeit and fictitious value to represent 
   natural values in commerce.  Unfortunately, 
human values have declined to fictitious 
word values.  Unknowingly, you are living 
in a "Word World",  as in a fictitious life 
in a counterfeit nation - which you could 
consider Matrix induced "Dream World". 
Can you distinguish the academic induced 
"Word World" from the natural "Real 
World"?  Beware of the change when your 
brain is free from induced"Word World" 
enslavement - for you could find that the 
natural "Real World" has been destroyed.

"The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.” 

“Recognize that the very molecules that make up your body, the atoms that construct the molecules, are traceable to the crucibles that were once the centers of high mass stars that exploded their chemically rich guts into the galaxy, enriching pristine gas clouds with the chemistry of life. So that we are all connected to each other biologically, to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically. That’s kinda cool! That makes me smile and I actually feel quite large at the end of that. It’s not that we are better than the universe, we are part of the universe. We are in the universe and the universe is in us.” 

“For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.” 

“The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you. 

“We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.” 

“Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.” 

“We spend the first year of a child's life teaching it to walk and talk and the rest of its life to shut up and sit down. There's something wrong there.” 

“The more I learn about the universe, the less convinced I am that there's any sort of benevolent force that has anything to do with it, at all.” 

“... there is no shame in not knowing. The problem arises when irrational thought and attendant behavior fill the vacuum left by ignorance.” 

“The knowledge that the atoms that comprise life on earth - the atoms that make up the human body, are traceable to the crucibles that cooked light elements into heavy elements in their core under extreme temperatures and pressures. These stars- the high mass ones among them- went unstable in their later years- they collapsed and then exploded- scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy- guts made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself. These ingredients become part of gas clouds that condense, collapse, form the next generation of solar systems- stars with orbiting planets. And those planets now have the ingredients for life itself. So that when I look up at the night sky, and I know that yes we are part of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the universe is in us. When I reflect on that fact, I look up- many people feel small, cause their small and the universe is big. But I feel big because my atoms came from those stars.” 

“People cited violation of the First Amendment when a New Jersey schoolteacher asserted that evolution and the Big Bang are not scientific and that Noah's ark carried dinosaurs. This case is not about the need to separate church and state; it's about the need to separate ignorant, scientifically illiterate people from the ranks of teachers.” 

“I would request that my body in death be buried not cremated, so that the energy content contained within it gets returned to the earth, so that flora and fauna can dine upon it, just as I have dined upon flora and fauna during my lifetime” 

“In 2002, having spent more than three years in one residence for the first time in my life, I got called for jury duty. I show up on time, ready to serve. When we get to the voir dire, the lawyer says to me, “I see you’re an astrophysicist. What’s that?” I answer, “Astrophysics is the laws of physics, applied to the universe—the Big Bang, black holes, that sort of thing.” Then he asks, “What do you teach at Princeton?” and I say, “I teach a class on the evaluation of evidence and the relative unreliability of eyewitness testimony.” Five minutes later, I’m on the street. 

A few years later, jury duty again. The judge states that the defendant is charged with possession of 1,700 milligrams of cocaine. It was found on his body, he was arrested, and he is now on trial. This time, after the Q&A is over, the judge asks us whether there are any questions we’d like to ask the court, and I say, “Yes, Your Honor. Why did you say he was in possession of 1,700 milligrams of cocaine? That equals 1.7 grams. The ‘thousand’ cancels with the ‘milli-’ and you get 1.7 grams, which is less than the weight of a dime.” Again I’m out on the street.” 

“I want to put on the table, not why 85% of the members of the National Academy of Sciences reject God, I want to know why 15% of the National Academy don’t.” 
― Neil deGrasse Tyson

“My view is that if your philosophy is not unsettled daily then you are blind to all the universe has to offer.” 

“God is an ever receding pocket of﻿ scientific ignorance.” 

“After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” 

“I look up at the night sky, and I know that, yes, we are part of this Universe, we are in this Universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the Universe is in us. When I reflect on that fact, I look up—many people feel small, because they’re small and the Universe is big, but I feel big, because my atoms came from those stars.” 

“I know that the molecules in my body are traceable to phenomena in the cosmos. That makes me want to grab people on the street and say: ‘Have you HEARD THIS?” 

“One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we have large groups of people who will accept whatever they hear on the grapevine, just because it suits their worldview—not because it is actually true or because they have evidence to support it. The really striking thing is that it would not take much effort to establish validity in most of these cases… but people prefer reassurance to research.” 

“I am convinced that the act of thinking logically cannot possibly be natural to the human mind. If it were, then mathematics would be everybody's easiest course at school and our species would not have taken several millennia to figure out the scientific method.” 

“Not only do we live among the stars, the stars live within us.” 

“Knowing how to think empowers you far beyond those who know only what to think.” 

“The atoms of our bodies are traceable to stars that manufactured them in their cores and exploded these enriched ingredients across our galaxy, billions of years ago. For this reason, we are biologically connected to every other living thing in the world. We are chemically connected to all molecules on Earth. And we are atomically connected to all atoms in the universe. We are not figuratively, but literally stardust.” 

“Kids are never the problem. They are born scientists. The problem is always the adults. They beat the curiosity out of kids. They outnumber kids. They vote. They wield resources. That's why my public focus is primarily adults.” 

“Whether or not you can never become great at something, you can always become better at it. Don't ever forget that! And don’t say “I’ll never be good”. You can become better! and one day you’ll wake up and you’ll find out how good you actually became.” 

“Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination” 

“When scientifically investigating the natural world, the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier.” 

“I would teach how science works as much as I would teach what science knows. I would assert (given that essentially, everyone will learn to read) that science literacy is the most important kind of literacy they can take into the 21st century. I would undervalue grades based on knowing things and find ways to reward curiosity. In the end, it's the people who are curious who change the world.” 

“So you're made of detritus [from exploded stars]. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” 

“Ignorance is a virus. Once it starts spreading, it can only be cured by reason. For the sake of humanity, we must be that cure.” 

“When asked about which scientist he'd like to meet, Neil deGrasse Tyson said, "Isaac Newton. No question about it. The smartest person ever to walk the face of this earth. The man was connected to the universe in spooky ways. He discovered the laws of motion, the laws of gravity, the laws of optics. Then he turned 26.” 

“Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.” 

“As a child, I was aware that, at night, infrared vision would reveal monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded.” 

“But you can’t be a scientist if you’re uncomfortable with ignorance, because scientists live at the boundary between what is known and unknown in the cosmos. This is very different from the way journalists portray us. So many articles begin, “Scientists now have to go back to the drawing board.” It’s as though we’re sitting in our offices, feet up on our desks—masters of the universe—and suddenly say, “Oops, somebody discovered something!” 

No. We’re always at the drawing board. If you’re not at the drawing board, you’re not making discoveries. You’re not a scientist; you’re something else. The public, on the other hand, seems to demand conclusive explanations as they leap without hesitation from statements of abject ignorance to statements of absolute certainty.”

“Down there between our legs, it's like an entertainment complex in the middle of a sewage system. Who designed that?” 

“Scientific inquiry shouldn't stop just because a reasonable explanation has apparently been found.” 

“Cutting PBS support (0.012% of budget) to help balance the Federal budget is like deleting text files to make room on your 500Gig hard drive” 

“So what is true for life itself is no less true for the universe: knowing where you came from is no less important than knowing where you are going.” 

“God is an ever-receding pocket of scientific ignorance that's getting smaller and smaller and smaller as﻿ time moves on.” 

“The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.” 

“Again and again across the centuries, cosmic discoveries have demoted our self-image. Earth was once assumed to be astronomically unique, until astronomers learned that Earth is just another planet orbiting the Sun. Then we presumed the Sun was unique, until we learned that the countless stars of the night sky are suns themselves. Then we presumed our galaxy, the Milky Way, was the entire known universe, until we established that the countless fuzzy things in the sky are other galaxies, dotting the landscape of our known universe.

Today, how easy it is to presume that one universe is all there is. Yet emerging theories of modern cosmology, as well as the continually reaffirmed improbability that anything is unique, require that we remain open to the latest assault on our plea for distinctiveness: multiple universes, otherwise known as the “multiverse,” in which ours is just one of countless bubbles bursting forth from the fabric of the cosmos.” 

“The remarkable feature of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them. After the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.” 

“While the Copernican principle comes with no guarantees that it will forever guide us to cosmic truths, it's worked quite well so far: not only is Earth not in the center of the solar system, but the solar system is not in the center of the Milky Way galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy is not in the center of the universe, and it may come to pass that our universe is just one of many that comprise a multiverse. And in case you're one of those people who thinks that the edge may be a special place, we are not at the edge of anything either.” 

“Our nation is turning into an idiocracy.” 

“When you visit countries that don't nurture these kinds of ambitions, you can feel th absence of hope...people are reduced to worrying only about that day's shelter or the next day's meal. It's a shame, even a tragedy, how many people do not get to think about the future. Technology coupled with wise leadership not only solves these problems but enables dreams of tomorow.” 

“Some molecules - ammonia, carbon dioxide, water - show up everywhere in the universe, whether life is present or not. But others pop up especially in the presence of life itself. Among the biomarkers in Earth's atmosphere are ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons from aerosol sprays, vapor from mineral solvents, escaped coolants from refrigerators and air conditioners, and smog from the burning of fossil fuels. No other way to read that list: sure signs of the absence of intelligence.” 

“We are all connected;
To each other, biologically.
To the earth, chemically.
To the rest of the universe
atomically".” 

“Allow intelligent design into science textbooks, lecture halls, and laboratories, and the cost to the frontier of scientific discovery—the frontier that drives the economies of the future—would be incalculable. I don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity. The day that happens, Americans will just sit in awe of what we don't understand, while we watch the rest of the world boldly go where no mortal has gone before.” 

“The most accessible field in science, from the point of view of language, is astrophysics. What do you call spots on the sun? Sunspots. Regions of space you fall into and you don’t come out of? Black holes. Big red stars? Red giants. So I take my fellow scientists to task. He’ll use his word, and if I understand it, I’ll say, “Oh, does that mean da-da-da-de-da?” 

“Doing what has never been done before is intellectually seductive, whether or not we deem it practical.” 

“Some morning while your're eating breakfast and you need something new to think about, though, you might want to ponder the fact that you see your kids across the table not as they are but as they once were, about three nanoseconds ago.” 

“Some of the greatest poetry is revealing to the reader the beauty in something that was so simple you had taken it for granted.” 

“In modern times, if the sole measure of what’s out there flows from your five senses then a precarious life awaits you.” 

“If humans one day become extinct from a catastrophic collision, there would be no greater tragedy in the history of life in the universe. Not because we lacked the brain power to protect ourselves but because we lacked the foresight. The dominant species that replaces us in post-apocalyptic Earth just might wonder, as they gaze upon our mounted skeletons in their natural history museums, why large-headed Homo sapiens fared no better than the proverbially pea-brained dinosaurs.” 

“I love the smell of the universe in the morning.” 

“In the twentieth century, astrophysicists in the United States discovered galaxies, the expanding of the universe, the nature of supernovas, quasars, black holes, gamma-ray bursts, the origin of the elements, the cosmic microwave background, and most of the known planets in orbit around solar systems other than our own. Although the Russians reached one or two places before us, we sent space probes to Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. American probes have also landed on Mars and on the asteroid Eros. And American astronauts have walked on the Moon. Nowadays most Americans take all this for granted, which is practically a working definition of culture: something everyone does or knows about, but no longer actively notices.

While shopping at the supermarket, most Americans aren’t surprised to find an entire aisle filled with sugar-loaded, ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. But foreigners notice this kind of thing immediately, just as traveling Americans notice that supermarkets in Italy display vast selections of pasta and that markets in China and Japan offer an astonishing variety of rice. The flip side of not noticing your own culture is one of the great pleasures of foreign travel: realizing what you hadn’t noticed about your own country, and noticing what the people of other countries no longer realize about themselves.” 

“People like death and mayhem.” 

“If you need to invoke your academic pedigree or job title for people to believe what you say, then you need a better argument.” 

“When your reasons for believing something are justified ad hoc, you are left susceptible to further discoveries undermining the rationale for that belief.” 

“I’m often asked by parents what advice can I give them to help get kids interested in science? And I have only one bit of advice. Get out of their way. Kids are born curious. Period. I don’t care about your economic background. I don’t care what town you’re born in, what city, what country. If you’re a child, you are curious about your environment. You’re overturning rocks. You’re plucking leaves off of trees and petals off of flowers, looking inside, and you’re doing things that create disorder in the lives of the adults around you.
And so then so what do adults do? They say, “Don’t pluck the petals off the flowers. I just spent money on that. Don’t play with the egg. It might break. Don’t….” Everything is a don’t. We spend the first year teaching them to walk and talk and the rest of their lives telling them to shut up and sit down.

So you get out of their way. And you know what you do? You put things in their midst that help them explore. Help ‘em explore. Why don’t you get a pair of binoculars, just leave it there one day? Watch ‘em pick it up. And watch ‘em look around. They’ll do all kinds of things with it.” 

“Robots are important also. If I don my pure-scientist hat, I would say just send robots; I'll stay down here and get the data. But nobody's ever given a parade for a robot. Nobody's ever named a high school after a robot. So when I don my public-educator hat, I have to recognize the elements of exploration that excite people. It's not only the discoveries and the beautiful photos that come down from the heavens; it's the vicarious participation in discovery itself.” 

“Let's grant that the stars are scattered through space, hither and yon. But how hither, and how yon? To the unaided eye the brightest stars are more than a hundred times brighter than the dimmest. So the dim ones are obviously a hundred times farther away from Earth, aren't they?

Nope.

That simple argument boldly assumes that all stars are intrinsically equally luminous, automatically making the near ones brighter than the far ones. Stars, however, come in a staggering range of luminosities, spanning ten orders of magnitude ten powers of ten. So the brightest stars are not necessarily the ones closest to Earth. In fact, most of the stars you see in the night sky are of the highly luminous variety, and they lie extraordinarily far away.

If most of the stars we see are highly luminous, then surely those stars are common throughout the galaxy.
Nope again.

High-luminosity stars are the rarest. In any given volume of space, they're outnumbered by the low-luminosity stars a thousand to one. It's the prodigious energy output of high-luminosity stars that enables you to see them across such large volumes of space.” 

“... informed ignorance provides the natural state of mind for research scientists at the ever-shifting frontiers of knowledge. People who believe themselves ignorant of nothing have neither looked for, nor stumbled upon, the boundary between what is known and unknown in the cosmos.” 

“Still, our knowledge of the planets was meager, and where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.” 

“You know that passage in the Bible that says, “And the meek shall inherit the Earth”? Always wondered if that was mistranslated. Perhaps it actually says, “And the geek shall inherit the Earth.” 

“Unlike what you may be told in other sectors of life, when observing the universe, size does matter, which often leads to polite ‘telescope envy’ at gatherings of amateur astronomers.” 

“By the way, were we to find life-forms on Venus, we would probably call them Venutians, just as people from Mars would be Martians. But according to rules of Latin genitives, to be “of Venus” ought to make you a Venereal. Unfortunately, medical doctors reached that word before astronomers did. Can’t blame them, I suppose. Venereal disease long predates astronomy, which itself stands as only the second oldest profession.” 

“There’s a fascinating frailty of the human mind that psychologists know all about, called “argument from ignorance.” This is how it goes. Remember what the “U” stands for in “UFO”? You see lights flashing in the sky. You’ve never seen anything like this before and don’t understand what it is. You say, “It’s a UFO!” The “U” stands for “unidentified.”
But then you say, “I don’t know what it is; it must be aliens from outer space, visiting from another planet.” The issue here is that if you don’t know what something is, your interpretation of it should stop immediately. You don’t then say it must be X or Y or Z. That’s argument from ignorance. It’s common. I’m not blaming anybody; it may relate to our burning need to manufacture answers because we feel uncomfortable about being steeped in ignorance.” 

“God is an ever-receding pocket of scientific ignorance.” 

“Science is a philosophy of discovery. Intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance.” 

“(Space programs are) a force operating on educational pipelines that stimulate the formation of scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians... They're the ones that make tomorrow come. The foundations of economies... issue forth from investments we make in science and technology.” 

“Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars. So you’re made of detritus. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?”

“I don’t have an issue with what you do in the church, but I’m gonna be up in your face if you’re gonna knock on my science classroom and tell me they’ve got to teach what you’re teaching in your Sunday school. Because that’s when we’re gonna fight!” 

“Long ago Mars was an oasis of running water.Today the Martiansurfaceis a sterile,barren desert. Here on Earth, who knows what climactic knobs we unwittingly turn,which might one day render Earth as dry and lifeless as Mars. (From the cover of Old Poison by Joan Francis)” 

“Imagine a life-form whose brainpower is to ours as ours is to a chimpanzee’s. To such a species, our highest mental achievements would be trivial. Their toddlers, instead of learning their ABCs on Sesame Street, would learn multivariable calculus on Boolean Boulevard. Our most complex theorems, our deepest philosophies, the cherished works of our most creative artists, would be projects their schoolkids bring home for Mom and Dad to display on the refrigerator door.” 

“You could also ask who’s in charge. Lots of people think, well, we’re humans; we’re the most intelligent and accomplished species; we’re in charge. Bacteria may have a different outlook: more bacteria live and work in one linear centimeter of your lower colon than all the humans who have ever lived. That’s what’s going on in your digestive tract right now. Are we in charge, or are we simply hosts for bacteria? It all depends on your outlook.” 

“In the beginning, there was physics. "Physics" describes how matter, energy, space, and time behave and interact with one another. The interplay of these characters in our cosmic drama underlies all biological and chemical phenomena. Hence everything fundamental and familiar to us earthlings begins with, and rests upon, the laws of physics. When we apply these laws to astronomical settings, we deal with physics writ large, which we call astrophysics.” 

“I get enormous satisfaction from knowing I'm doing something for society.” 

“The moment when someone attaches you to a philosophy or a movement, then they assign all the baggage and all the rest of the philosophy that goes with it to you. And when you want to have a conversation, they will assert that they already know everything important there is to know about you because of that association. And that's not the way to have a conversation.” 

“The more of us that feel the universe, the better off we will be in this world.” 

“Our academic system rewards people who know a lot of stuff and generally we call those people smart, but at the end of the day who do you want- the person who can figure things out that they've never seen before or the person who can rattle off a bunch of facts?” 

“What are the lessons to be learned from this journey of the mind? That humans are emotionally fragile, perennially gullible, hopelessly ignorant masters of an insignificantly small speck in the cosmos. Have a nice day.” 

“Science literacy is an important part of what it is to be an informed citizen of society.” 

“Like the microscopic strands of DNA that predetermine the identity of a macroscopic species and the unique propertires of its members, the modern look and feel of the cosmos was writ in the fabric of its earliest moments, and carried relentlessly through time and space. We feel it when we look up. We feel it when we look down. We feel it when we look within.” 

“When people believe a tale that conflicts with self-checkable evidence it tells me that people undervalue the role of evidence on formulating an internal belief system. Why this is so is not clear, but it enables many people to hold fast to ideas and notions based purely on supposition.” 

“There’s as many atoms in a single molecule of your DNA as there are stars in the typical galaxy. We are, each of us, a little universe.” 

“If everyone had the luxury to pursue a life of exactly what they love, we would all be ranked as visionary and brilliant. … If you got to spend every day of your life doing what you love, you can’t help but be the best in the world at that. And you get to smile every day for doing so. And you’ll be working at it almost to the exclusion of personal hygiene, and your friends are knocking on your door, saying, “Don’t you need a vacation?!,” and you don’t even know what the word “vacation” means because what you’re doing is what you want to do and a vacation from that is anything but a vacation — that’s the state of mind of somebody who’s doing what others might call visionary and brilliant.” 

“The options available to a creative person are ever limited by the choices offered by a philosopher.” 

“We conquer the Independence Day aliens by having a Macintosh laptop computer upload a software virus to the mothership (which happens to be one-fifth the mass of the Moon), thus disarming its protective force field. I don’t know about you, but back in 1996 I had trouble just uploading files to other computers within my own department, especially when the operating systems were different. There is only one solution: the entire defense system for the alien mothership must have been powered by the same release of Apple Computer’s system software as the laptop computer that delivered the virus.” 

“There are no limits when you are surrounded by people who believe in you, or by people whose expectations are not set by the short-sighted attitudes of society, or by people who help to open doors of opportunity, not close them.” 

“When students cheat on exams it's because our school system values grades more than students value learning.” 

“When you organize extraordinary missions, you attract people of extraordinary talent who might not have been inspired by or attracted to the goal of saving the world from cancer or hunger or pestilence.” 

“Science, enabled by engineering, empowered by NASA, tells us not only that we are in the universe but that the universe is in us. And for me, that sense of belonging elevates, not denigrates, the ego.” 

“Some people think emotionally more often than they think politically. Some think politically more often than they think rationally. Others never think rationally about anything at all.
No judgment implied. Just an observation.” 

“Science needs the light of free expression to flourish. It depends on the fearless questioning of authority, and the open exchange of ideas.” 

“Each component of this trinity of human endeavor—science, religion, and art—lays powerful claim to our feelings of wonder, which derive from an embrace of the mysterious. Where mystery is absent, there can be no wonder.” 

“Perhaps these ancient observations perennially impress modern people because modern people have no idea how the sun, Moon, or stars move. We are too busy watching evening television to care what's going on in the sky. To us, a simple rock alignment based on cosmic patterns looks like an Einsteinian feat. But a truly mysterious civilization would be one that made no cultural or architectural reference to the sky at all.” 

“Equipped with his five senses, man explores the universe around him and calls the adventure science. 
“The four most common chemically active elements in the universe—hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen—are the four most common elements of life on Earth. We are not simply in the universe. The universe is in us.” 

“Science is a philosophy of discovery. Intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance. You cannot build a program of discovery on the assumption that nobody is smart enough to figure out the answer to a problem.” 

“How do you study something that cannot possibly get your clothes dirty? How do astrophysicists know anything about either the universe or its contents if all the objects to be studied are light-years away? Fortunately, the light emanating from a star reveals much more to us than its position in the sky or how bright it is.” 

“I look forward to the day when the solar system becomes our collective backyard—explored not only with robots, but with the mind, body, and soul of our species.” 

“If the whole world shared such experiences, we would then have common dreams and everybody could begin thinking about tomorrow. And if everybody thinks about tomorrow, then someday we can visit the sky together.” 

“Science literacy is being plugged into the forces that power the universe. There is no excuse for thinking that the Sun, which is a million times the size of Earth, orbits Earth.” 

“there is no shame in not knowing. The problem arises when irrational thought and attendant behavior fill the vacuum left by ignorance.” 

“Suppose a hole were dug from one side of Earth, through the center, and out the other side. What would happen to a man if he jumped into the hole? When he got to the middle of the Earth would he keep falling or would he stop? DEBBIE CANDLER RED BUD, ILLINOIS He would be vaporized by the 11,000° Fahrenheit temperature of the pressurized molten iron core. Ignoring this complication, he would gain speed continuously from the moment he jumped into the hole until he reached the center of Earth where the force of gravity is zero. But he will be traveling so fast that he will overshoot the center and slow down continuously until he reached zero velocity at the exact moment he emerges on the other side. Unless somebody grabs him, he will fall back down the hole and repeat his journey indefinitely. A one-way trip through Earth would take about forty-five minutes.” 

“Some of the greatest poetry is reviling to the reader the beauty in something that was so simple you had taken it for granted.” 

“Even the successful 1985 Bret Easton Ellis book (and 1987 film) Less Than Zero, which tracks the falling from grace of wealthy Los Angeles teens, could not be imagined with the logically equivalent title: Negative.” 

“In short, were it not for our ability to analyze spectra, we would know next to nothing about what goes on in the universe.” 

“People who believe themselves ignorant of nothing have neither looked for, nor stumbled upon, the boundary between what is known and unknown in the cosmos. And therein lies a fascinating dichotomy. “The universe always was,” gets no respect as a legitimate answer to “What was around before the beginning?” But for many religious people, the answer, “God always was,” is the obvious and pleasing answer to “What was around before God?” 

“the astronomy embodied in Stonehenge is not fundamentally deeper than what can be discovered with a stick in the ground. Perhaps these ancient observatories perennially impress modern people because modern people have no idea how the Sun, Moon, or stars move. We are too busy watching evening television to care what’s going on in the sky. To us, a simple rock alignment based on cosmic patterns looks like an Einsteinian feat. But a truly mysterious civilization would be one that made no cultural or architectural reference to the sky at all.” 

“The cosmic perspective not only embraces our genetic kinship with all life on Earth but also values our chemical kinship with any yet-to-be discovered life in the universe, as well as our atomic kinship with the universe itself.” 

“Heroic adventures through the Sun are best taken by photons and not by any other form of energy or matter. If any of us were to go on the same trip then we would, of course, be crushed to death, vaporized, and have every single electron stripped from our body’s atoms. Aside from these setbacks, I imagine one could easily sell tickets for such a voyage. For me, though, I am content just knowing the story.” 

“In the beginning, there was physics.” 

“As religion is now practiced and science is now practiced, there is no intersection between the two. That is for certain. And it's not for want of trying. Over the centuries, many people - theologians as well scientists - have tried to explore points of intersection. And anytime anyone has declared that harmony has risen up, it is the consequence of religion acquiescing to scientific discovery. In every single case.”
